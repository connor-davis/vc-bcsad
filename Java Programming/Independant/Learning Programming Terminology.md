- A **computer program** is a set of instructions that you write to tell a computer what to do.
- Computer equipment such as a monitor or keyboard, is **hardware**, and programs are **software**. 
- A program that performs tasks for a user is called an **application software**.
- A program that manages the system itself is called a **system software**.
- The **logic** behind any program, determines the exact order of instructions needed to produce the desired results.
- You can write computer programmes in one of the [[High-Level Programming Languages]].
- **Low-level** languages are not as easily read and understood.
- All programs are converted to the **Low-level** language known as **Machine Code**, which the computer can execute.
- **Machine Code** is often represented as 1's and 0's to represent the on-off circuitry of computer systems.

- Every programming language has its own **syntax**, which are rules on how language elements are combined to produce usable statements.
- Programmers write a series of **Program statements**, which are similar to English sentences.
- **Program statements** are also known as **commands**. They are orders to the computer, e.g. *Output this*, *Add that*
- A **compiler** or **interpreter** translates the statements into **Machine code**.
