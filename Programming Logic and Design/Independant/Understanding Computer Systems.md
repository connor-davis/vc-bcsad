- **Hardware** is the equipment associated with a computer.
- Computer hardware needs instructions that control its operations.

- **Software** is the instructions given to a computer that tells the hardware what to do.
- Software is **programs** written by **programmers** that give instructions to the hardware.

Software can be classified into two broad types:
- **Application software** comprises all the programs you apply to a task.
- **System software** comprises all the programs you use to manage your computer.

Together; Software and hardware accomplish three major operations in most programs:
- **Input** - Data enters the computer system and gets placed in memory to be processed.
- **Processing** - Processing data involves sorting, checking or even performing calculations.
- **Output** - Once data is processed it is outputted to an output device where people can view, interpret, and use the results.
